# jameson-compatibility
Implements Jameson-only primitives in Snap! using the [Crackle SDK](https://github.com/CrackleTeam/CrackleSDK).

## Installation
First, download the latest Crackle extension from [here](https://github.com/CrackleTeam/CrackleSDK/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it. Follow [these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) to install it.

Afterwards, obtain a copy of the mod [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPPDUD/jameson-compatibility/refs/heads/main/jameson-compatibility.js). Visit [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html) and click the plus button:

Click _Load mod from file..._ and select the JS file that you downloaded earlier.

Note that the libraries for using these primitives are not included.

## Obtaining the UUID generation libraries
Currently, the only primitives unique to Jameson enable secure UUID generation. To import the high-level library which provides an interface to these primitives, download it from [here](https://mojavesoft.net/ide/libraries/uuid_blocks.xml) and import it into Snap!.
